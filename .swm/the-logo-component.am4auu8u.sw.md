# What is the 'Logo' component

The 'Logo' component is a functional component in React. It returns a link element that, when clicked, redirects the user to the homepage. The link element contains an SVG image and a heading with the text 'CovidPass'. The SVG image and the heading are styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

```javascript
function Logo() {
    return (
        <Link href="/">
            <a className="flex flex-row items-center p-3 justify-center space-x-1">
                <svg className="fill-current" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enableBackground="new 0 0 24 24"
                     height="48px"
                     viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="48px" fill="#000000">
                    <g>
                        <path d="M0,0h24v24H0V0z" fill="none"/>
                    </g>
                    <g>
                        <path
