# Main classes/functions/files related to 'Vaccination Certificate'

The 'pass.js' file contains the structure of the 'Vaccination Certificate'. It includes properties such as 'Certificate Type', 'Date of Vaccination', 'Country of Vaccination', 'Vaccine', and 'Unique Certificate Identifier (UVCI)'. Each property is defined with a key, label, and value.

```javascript
        {
          key: "type",
          label: "Certificate Type",
          value: payload.certificateType
        }
      ],
      primaryFields: [
        {
          key: "name",
          label: "Name",
          value: payload.name
        }
      ],
      secondaryFields: [
        {
          key: "dose",
          label: "Dose",
          value: payload.dose
        },
        {

The 'payload.js' file is where the 'Vaccination Certificate' data is being set. It includes properties such as 'certificateType', 'backgroundColor', 'name', 'dose', 'dateOfVaccination', 'dateOfBirth', and 'uvci'.

```javascript
    this.certificateType = 'Vaccination'

    this.backgroundColor = backgroundColor
    this.labelColor = labelColor
    this.foregroundColor = foregroundColor
    this.img1x = img1x
    this.img2x = img2x

    this.raw = rawData
    this.dark = dark

    this.name = name
    this.dose = dose
    this.dateOfVaccination = dateOfVaccination
```
